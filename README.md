## sculk-loom

sculk-loom is a regolith-based addon compiler focused on scripting development with TypeScript. With resemblance to fabric-loom, this implements the concept of project folders, allowing you to import your add-on files from outside of your com.mojang folder, which also offers an extra protection layer from you loosing your progress if the com.mojang folder, somehow, dissapears or is deleted.

This tesselator is focused on implementing Teseract's [server-api](https://github.com/TeseractMCS/server-api) in your project, allowing you to take advantage of new fresh features implemented by server-api with a vanillish style.
